        <h2>3DTroids</h2>
        <p>This is a 3D Game where you control a space ship in a Flappy Bird style game. The main objective is to get as many points as possible without crashing into an asteroid as you go, and crashing into it will reset your score back to 0.</p>

        <h2>Zombie Fighters</h2>
        <p>This is a game where you control a character and have to survive for as long as possible. The game has a neverending loop of zombies that will keep coming after you, so it can be tedious at points, however you have the ability to quit at any point by pressing escape.</p>
