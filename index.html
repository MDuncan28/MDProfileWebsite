            <h3>Hi, I'm Matthew Duncan!</h3>
            <p>I am currently a first-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for programming, problem-solving, and automation. I have experience working with C, C++, Java, SQL Server, Python, as well as HTML and CSS to build this site, and I’m eager to continue expanding my skills by learning new languages. My goal is to become a Software Engineer and contribute to building software that will positively impact and shape people’s futures.</p>
